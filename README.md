What is unsupervised learning?
This is a machine learning technique that combines statistics with algorithms to create models which can learn patterns based on training data which is fed into it. In the context of this challenge, it uses a data set about crypto market data and clusters the crypto currencies into an optimal number of groups using K-Means clustering.
